Describe the fixes/improvements you made to the Graph implementation here.

- In 'graph.py' file within the add_edge method, I added end to the start and start to the end if bidirectional so the edges would display corrently in the graph demo.

- In 'graph.py' file within the depth first search(dfs) method, I made the variable names more intuitive and easy to read for the next developer.
