Describe the fixes/improvements you made to the Graph implementation here.

1. `add_edge`: <br>
`add_edge` was adding from `start` to `start` rather than `start` to `end` and vice versa
<br> <br>
2. `dfs`: <br>
Variable names were really confusing so I rewrote it with clearer names, left old code for reference. Implemented a stack. <br> <br>
