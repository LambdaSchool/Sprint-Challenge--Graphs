Describe the fixes/improvements you made to the Graph implementation here.

- add_edge method in Graph class fixed: edges appropriately attached to 2 different vertices going both ways. 
- add_vertex method updated to create a new object from the vertex class when a vertex is added.
- added edges parameter to vertex class
- add_edge method error checking added: Edges can be build a bidirectional and single-directional.
