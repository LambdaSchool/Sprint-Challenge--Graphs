Describe the fixes/improvements you made to the Graph implementation here.
changes to graph.py
22. added start Add = a edge (default bidirectional) between two vertices

24. added a end
it needs a begining and end

27.added stack Search the graph using BFS or DFS bfs is stack


28.add stack to append and stack 

29.added visited stack inside set

31. added stack
32.added current.pops the last one

33. added current .add the current to the stack - add the current to the stack

34.added return target - check if found target

35.added visited and current-add the current to the stack

36.added stack,current, visited - subtract whats visited from the vertices and whats remaining, add it to the stack


42.change bfs same as above just using queue and instead of popping last we pop first one first

43. change queue
44.added queue to appended
45. added info for bfs
this has been fun
