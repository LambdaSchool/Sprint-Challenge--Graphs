Describe the fixes you made to the Graph implementation here.

Line 75: removed for loop and moved fillText inside the for loop initially used for 'Draw the verts on top'. It will now have same color for all connected verticies.

Line 158: onClick was linked to non-exisiting function. Fixed path to proper function. 'onButton()'
