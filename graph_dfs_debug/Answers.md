Describe the fixes you made to the Graph implementation here.
#1 The vertexes was missing color, it needed to have ctx.fillStyle to equal color, the button wasn't calling the correct method for the onClick event, renaming what was called for the onClick fixed the button. For the part of the graph not rendering completely, I changed the xCount and yCount to match (increasing both), and decreased the boxSize as a precaution. The graph looks weird because getConnectedComponents() connects vertexes that are on different branches, it goes depth first, returns and goes on the other direction; there are different methods of doing DFS, but only one way to do BFS. Because of the multiple methods for DFS, the graph is not guaranteed to get the same result as BFS (which is why it looks odd).
