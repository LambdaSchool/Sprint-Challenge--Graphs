Describe the fixes you made to the Graph implementation here.

The bug with the randomize button is that you named the the button function `onButton` but in render you called `this.Button`. You need to call it by the function name you gave it. 

The bug with the graph getting cut off and being drawn crazily is because in the line ` return <canvas ref="canvas" width={canvasHeight} height={canvasHeight}></canvas>;` you're calling `canvasHeight` for both the width and the height when you should be calling `canvasWidth` for width instead of `canvasHeight`. Changing the line to ` return <canvas ref="canvas" width={canvasWidth} height={canvasHeight}></canvas>;` fixes the bug to where the canvas is the correct size and the graphs are being drawn properly. 

The bug with the coloring of the edges and vertexes is because in the dfs function the line ` stack.shift(); // de-stack` was inside the `while loop`. It can't be inside the while loop because the de-stacking will happen while the while loop is going and it needs to be outside of the while loop. And then in the `drawVerts` function you needed to change the hard coded line `ctx.fillStyle = '#77f'; ` to this instead `ctx.fillStyle = color;`. And that will fix the color bug happening.
