Describe the fixes you made to the Graph implementation here.

I fixed the width inside the render function of app.js 

Added position into vertex in graph.js

Removed DFS and added in BFS to transverse the nodes.

changed the x count and y count inside app.js 

Changed the color function but later changed it back because it did not seem to change anything. 


Some problems im still having is sometimes the graphs don't color differently for some reason and sometimes the nodes appear really close to each other despite having distance required between them.
