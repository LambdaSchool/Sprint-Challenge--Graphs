Describe the fixes/improvements you made to the Graph implementation here.

Renamed _get_edge_indexes to _get_edge_indices per correct grammer

Imported Graph and BokehGraph because I thought they were necessary for the graph_demo file to run

Renamed dfs components to reflect conventions in this week's repo

Created/renamed graph_rec to be recursive_helper and renamed its component elements to be more intuitive

Switched the .add(start) and .add(end) in the add_edge in order to make it work poroperly
