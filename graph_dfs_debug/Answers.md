Describe the fixes you made to the Graph implementation here.

first i fixed the button by changing the onClick from calling Button to calling onButton

in the second for loop for vertexes i swaped ctx.fill and ctx.stroke 
removed the closing call to graphview as it is a self closing element


i commented out your second stack deque call only 1 is needed
