Describe the fixes/improvements you made to the Graph implementation here.
Added edges to vertices ie: self.vertices[start].add(end).  Made DFS work correctly by adding popped off items to a set and adding the children of the popped off item that haven't already been checked to an array to be processed.  Made graph_rec function call itself correctly ie: used self. in front of the function name.  Made find_components only check vertexes that have not been visited.
