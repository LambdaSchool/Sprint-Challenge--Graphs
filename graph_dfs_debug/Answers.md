Describe the fixes/improvements you made to the Graph implementation here.

Fixed the add_edge method in the Graph class, the edges are attached to 2 different vertices going both ways.

The graph_rec needed a self.graph_rec

Changed dfs method to make things more clear

Needed to add not in visited , if I didn't the result would only show 1 color
