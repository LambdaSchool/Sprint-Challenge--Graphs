Describe the fixes/improvements you made to the Graph implementation here.

I added the logic of number of vertices in graph and however many numbers of vertices in graph to be returned.
I kept track of all the nodes that were visited and checked using the queue
then popped the lowest node from the queue
then added the node to the list of checked nodes.
