Describe the fixes/improvements you made to the Graph implementation here.

in graph
-changed add_edge so that edges dont start/end from where they are not supposed to(still doesnt fix bug)
-removed the dfs function and added a different implementation
-added a not in the find_components because we don't want to look for the vertices in the visited
