Describe the fixes you made to the Graph implementation here.


1 - corrected spelling  the function in the  Onclick button 
2 - corrected the extra shift() in the dfs because pop() is doing the job inside the while loop;
3 - corrected the color parameter in the vertex drawing function , because it is a random color and not "blue"
4 - fixed the size of the canvas to fit correctly the size of the graph 
5 - I adde the pos parameter to the vertex constructor 
6 - i commented it out the function updateCanvasEntireGraph()
