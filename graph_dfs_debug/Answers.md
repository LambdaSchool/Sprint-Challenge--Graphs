# Graph.py

* Changed line 22 - 24. add_edge had the edgeings going from start to start and the end to end. Changed that to start to end and end to start.

* Line 27 changed x to stack so its a bit more clear what is it.

* Line 29 changed y to visited also for clearity.

* line 32 changed 'z' to visiting

* Line 34 changed block statement into a print statement just so I have a better idea whats going on.  

* line 40 - 44 changed all the x vars into visited for better description. If we are to call recursion, we need to use 'self' on the func name otherwise the linter will read it as a var
