Describe the fixes you made to the Graph implementation here.

- Changed the button onClick from this.Button to this.onButton, as that is what the function is called

- Fixed the box size, changed the canvas width under render to canvasWidth instead of canvasHeight

- Changed the fillStyle for the circles to be color

- Removed stack.shift as the const u is already equal to stack.pop()
