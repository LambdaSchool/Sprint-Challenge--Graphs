#Help!

Hi Friend,

After learning about breadth-first-search, I decided to give depth-first-search a try. I'm pretty sure I've almost got it working, but I can't figure out the last few bugs. Can you help? I've got the following issues. I'm not sure if the order here matters, you might have to fix them in a different order than they are listed.

1.  The graph draws crazily.

# had shift and pop in there, commented out shift on line 139, and changed pop to shift on line 131

2.  All the vertexes are the same color. They're supposed to match the color of the edges for each connected component.

# you had the color hardcoded on line 64, i set it to use the color var

3.  My randomize button is broken.

# had to fix the function name on the button, it wasnt calling onButton function

4.  It looks like part of the graph is getting cut off.

# had to fix render method. it was setting width and height to the same value.

I'm still trying to learn this stuff, so please don't just fix the code for me. Let me know where my bugs are and what you did to fix them, so I can have an easier time watching out for them next time!

Thanks!
