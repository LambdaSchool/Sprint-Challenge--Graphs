Hello Pal,

You suck for the following reasons:

You didn't use a .gitignore for some damn reason.

You use the word `vertexes` instead of `vertices`

For some fucking reason, you used `ctx.fillStyle = '#77f';` instead of `ctx.fillStyle = color;` before drawing your vertices.

Your current setup is designed for squares, so xCount and yCount need to be the same for the graph to draw correctly.

You called for `this.Button` instead of `this.onButton` for the Random button's onClick.
