1. To create 100 users with an average of 10 friends each, how many times would you need to call `addFriendship()`? Why? (1pt)

users avg friends = users * avg / 2 => 500




2. If you create 1000 users with an average of 5 random friends each, what percentage of other users will be in a particular user's extended social network? What is the average degree of separation between a user and those in his/her extended network? (2pts)
