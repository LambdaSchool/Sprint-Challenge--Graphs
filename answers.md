Questions

1. to create 100 users with an average of 10 friends each, 
    how many times would you need to call 'addFriendship()'? why?

    With a tree of friends, each friend would add each other so if you add 1 friend then you have a branch where each friend gains 1 friend and do users avg friends = users * avg / 2 => 500

2. if you create 1000 users with an average of 5 random friends each, 
    what percentage of other users will be in a particular user's extended social network? 
    What is the average degree of separation between a user and those in his/her extended network?
